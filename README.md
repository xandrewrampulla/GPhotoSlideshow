This is a simple application that displays the photos from 
your Google Photo account on a tablet.  The intent is to use 
this as a digital picture frame.


This is being committed without the necessary google-services.json
because that contains my SSH key which should not be distributed.  
This file can be created by anyone who requires it by following the
directions on https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/start-integrating

Be kind, this is my first Android application and was written primarily
as a learning experience.  I still need to figure out how to best
write unit tests for this kind of code though.
